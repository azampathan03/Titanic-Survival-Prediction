# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
### **Overview**

This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning. By analyzing features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare, the model identifies patterns that influenced survival rates during the 1912 disaster. The goal is to demonstrate data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling techniques.

### **Key Features**

âœ…Â **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**Â â€“ Visualizing survival trends based on demographics and socio-economic factors.

âœ…Â **Data Preprocessing**Â â€“ Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

âœ…Â **Feature Importance**Â â€“ Identifying which factors most impacted survival (e.g., "Women and children first").

âœ…**Interactive UI**â€“ Input passenger details and get instant survival predictions

âœ…**Machine Learning Model**â€“**Random Forest** trained on historical passenger data

âœ…**Deployed Web App**â€“ Accessible to anyone via a live link

### **Technologies Used**

- **Python**Â (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)
- **Data Visualization**Â (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Google Colab**Â (for analysis and reporting)
- **Streamlit**Â (for web deployment)

### **Results**

- AchievedÂ **~80% accuracy**Â with optimized Random Forest.
- Key findings:
    - **1st-class passengers**Â had significantly higher survival rates.
    - **Women and children**Â were prioritized in lifeboats.
    - **Fare price**Â correlated with survival chances.
